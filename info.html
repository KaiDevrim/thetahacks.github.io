What is ThetaHacks?
ThetaHacks is a global high-school virtual hackathon occurring from January 15-18, 2021. Anyone of any skill level is free to submit a project that benefits the world around us. Our event is free, with tons of epic swag, events, and more. 

During our hackathon, you can form a team of up to 4 people to code anything you want! Attend various workshops and speaker events throughout the long weekend, while hanging out in our (discord) community and getting a ton of free swag. And yes, the more events you attend in our hackathon, the more free swag and merch you get. 

To attend our event, it is required to sign up on our website and devpost. 
Have questions? Join our Discord or shoot us an email!

3rd: $70 and a certificate, something brewing

Best Duo Hack: 2x Discord Premium Merch/Swag
Best project made by two people only. Discord merch includes a shirt, pins, stickers, and more!
Best Beginner Hack: Four Google Home Minis
By competing in the beginning league, you cannot earn a podium award and have to be relatively new to coding. We encourage new coders to sign up to win this award!
