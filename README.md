# ThetaHacks Official Website
The official site for ThetaHacks, a high school hackathon located in Sunnyvale, CA. 

ThetaHacks will be a 24-hour in-person hackathon, with teams of up to four persons.

Due to COVID-19, the official date for the 2021 in-person hackathon has not been determined yet. We will be monitoring conditions to decide when it is safe enough to hold the hackathon. Currently, we are aiming to host the hackathon around February, but this is by no means a final date.

### Team
